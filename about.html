          <p>Was it in your boot? Did you find it nestled beneath your pillow, perhaps?</p>
          <p>What do I mean? Why, your ticket to the Witchlight Carnival, of course. Witness the spectacle that comes, but once every eight years.</p>
          <p>Listen for the calliope and follow the wonder in your soul. Come, enter the carnival grounds, a traveling piece of the Feywild whose dazzling wagons arrive upon enormous fluttering butterfly wings. Show your ticket at the gate and partake of the carnival's myriad marvels!</p>
          <p>The carnival offers a feast for the senses and an indulgence of dreams. Take in the talents of performers who have come to us from worlds away! Explore the Hall of Illusions, the Mystery Mine, the Pixie Kingdom and more. Try your hand at some games and win delightful prizes.</p>
          <p>How long the carnival stays put is a mystery to everyone, but Mister Witch. When the time of departure comes, the word is given, the wagons are packed, and the festivities are borne elsewhere. Once the carnival is gone, you must wait eight years for its return.</p>

            <p>One half of Witchlight is the ever stern and always dapper Mister Witch. If you put an ear to his chest, we wager you'd hear the ticking of a clock, given his obsession with time and the carnival's strict adherence to schedules.</p>

            <p>Unlike his morose partner, Mister Light lives for joy. It's infectious, really. He's always in costume, his makeup flawless. And he's constantly twirling that butterfly-topped scepter of his. Mister Light is perfectly adapted to life in the carnival.</p>

            <p>
              Northwind embodies the joys of spring, finding childlike wonder in everything from a story told by a stranger to a drop of morning dew. The sapling hails from a line of Feywild treants and travels as the Witchlight Carnival’s landscaper, laying down silk ribbons to form rivers and planting acorns that grow rapidly into splendid oak trees.

The keg fastened to its collar is filled with toffee apple juice and fitted with a spigot for easy pouring. The juice never fails to console an upset child.</p>

              Candlefoot’s appearance is strangely monochromatic, due to the chaotic magic of a reckless sorcerer to whom he was apprenticed in his youth. After fleeing his master, Candlefoot found a home in the Witchlight Carnival.

            <p>These are the backbone of the Witchlight Carnival, a motley collection of individuals who operate many of the booths, make repairs, feed and exercise the animals, keep an eye out for thieves and other miscreants, and perform other miscellaneous tasks as Mister Witch dictates. A few also work part-time as performers and attractions. Although they travel to many worlds throughout the Material Plane, Witchlight hands rarely leave the carnival grounds. The carnival is the only world they know and care about.
